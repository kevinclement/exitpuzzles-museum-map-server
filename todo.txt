[x] magnet object
  [x] location
  [x] pin
  [x] state
[x] magnet state - gpio
  [x] update db
[ ] overall state
  [x] image: 'images/FINAL.bmp'
    [x] why - at one point thought I could just change image with it, but

  [x] is_solved
  [x] magnets array of objects
[x] success state
  [x] update db
[x] reset picture after timeout
  [x] time to wait - 10s
  [x] update db
[ ] handle reset from website
  [ ] needs to clear state in a bunch of places?  
[ ] audio
[ ] db info
  [ ] magnets
  [ ] image
  [ ] solved
  [ ] force
[ ] run state
  [ ] finished
  [ ] force
  [ ] timestamp
[ ] should I add ability to override per city?
[ ] force solve
[ ] ask kyle about timeout behavior
  [ ] do we want a change to that?
    right now its 10s of unsolved
    also allows for solve and then unsolve and then solve again without some sore of global reset
[x] db start and ping time


[ ] tempature - probably punt

[ ] what needs to be updated since I changed server from pedestal to map
  [ ] should I just have both statuses?

// changes due to wire mapping?
