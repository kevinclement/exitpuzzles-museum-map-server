  [ ] timeout behavior
    do we want a change to that?
    right now its 10s of unsolved
    also allows for solve and then unsolve and then solve again without some sore of global reset

    if all magnets are in place and you reboot it, it will blink and do the solve.  is this desired?  it was more work to do it


[ ] temperature - probably punt

[ ] what needs to be updated since I changed server from pedestal to map
  [ ] should I just have both statuses?
