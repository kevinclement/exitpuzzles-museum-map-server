[ ] when I did a force solve for map, got a callback error in console

[ ] turn off system start of python service
  [ ] maybe rename source folder?
[ ] check in to master for service
[ ] refresh main service
[ ] checkin master webapp

[ ] nit: cleanup old ops still hanging out in db
[ ] nit: move legend image up?
[ ] nit: image swap is faster, need to adjust sound?

[ ] fix typing override timer problem with dashboard

[ ] temperature - probably punt

// -----------------------------------------------
[x] db start and ping time
[x] magnet object
  [x] location
  [x] pin
  [x] state
[x] magnet state - gpio
  [x] update db
[x] overall state
  [x] image: 'images/FINAL.bmp'
    [x] why - at one point thought I could just change image with it, but 
      didn't end up using it like that so removed hack and just have a string
  [x] is_solved
  [x] magnets array of objects
[x] success state
  [x] update db
[x] reset picture after timeout
  [x] time to wait - 10s
  [x] update db
[x] db info
  [x] magnets
  [x] image
  [x] solved
  [x] force
[x] audio 
[x] handle reset from website
  [x] needs to clear state in a bunch of places?  
[x] handle force from website
  [x] hookup js handler
  [\] update db
[x] cleanup force from web ui
[x] asks for kyle:    
  [x] timeout behavior
    do we want a change to that?
    right now its 10s of unsolved
    also allows for solve and then unsolve and then solve again without some sore of global reset
    - confirmed from kyle its good as is
  [x] reboot/reset behaviors
    if all magnets are in place and you reboot it, it will blink and do the solve.  is this desired?  it was more work to do it
      yes, confirmed its desirable
  [x] should I add ability to trigger audio only, or blink?  ask kyle
    [x] hes fine with it like this
[x] run state
  [x] finished
  [x] force
  [x] timestamp
[x] what changes do I need in reset dialog in webapp?
  prob force related
[x] what needs to be updated since I changed server from pedestal to map
  - turns out app was driven by map status, which python used, so changing to map should be the same
[x] should I add ability to override per city?
[x] add overrides to production db
[x] add all pins/locations back
[x] switch firebase to production
[x] manual test
  [x] mag on/off
  [x] all on, then solve
  [x] once solved, one off goes to unsolved
  [x] reboot/reset via webapp
  [x] force
  [x] run reporting
  [x] reset dialog resets the device
[x] turn back on cabinet handler
